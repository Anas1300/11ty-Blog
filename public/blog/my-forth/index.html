      <h2>üö© Introduction</h2>
<p>Hell yeah, that would be cool. üòé So this is gonna be about <strong>fine-tuning your css</strong> designs in a manner that would make your <strong>pages load faster</strong> üöÄ as well as make your designs all <strong>browser compatible</strong>. üíª And by all means, make your CSS production ready for getting the best out of your CSS. üéâ</p>
<p>Yes, the above image is from the console and you can customize the text however you like. To know how keep reading till the end.</p>
<p>It's been a while since my last post, it's because I got into learning some interesting stuff and undoubtedly writer's block was back. But recently, while working on a large repository that had a lot of stuff logged in the console I wanted a way to clear all the clutter and make my console statements stand out from the rest.</p>
<p>Here is how I was able to do that and how you could too.</p>
<p>So these are the possible options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using different console methods</li>
<li>Using various format specifiers (believe me, this is magic ‚ú®)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using different console methods</h2>
<p>You might already know some of the basic ones, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>console.log</li>
<li>console.info</li>
<li>console.error</li>
<li>console.warn</li>
</ul>
<h2>console.table</h2>
<p>This can be used to log large nested objects or arrays so you don't have to go through expanding each key to view the whole thing.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let peoples = [
  {
    name: &quot;Richard Hendricks&quot;,
    location: &quot;Berkely&quot;,
    cell: &quot;4254-024-8162&quot;,
    age: 32,
  },
  {
    name: &quot;Christiansen Frederikke&quot;,
    location: &quot;Madras&quot;,
    cell: &quot;4987-024-2562&quot;,
    age: 34,
  },
  {
    name: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
    location: &quot;California&quot;,
    cell: &quot;3143-344-342&quot;,
    age: 53,
  },
];

console.table(peoples);
</code></pre>
<h2>console.group and console.groupEnd</h2>
<p>You can group a set of console logs having a particular meaning apart from the rest using this method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const title = &quot;Me and my boys&quot;;

console.group(title);
console.table(peoples[0]);
console.info(&quot;Weather is very beautiful today ‚òÅ&quot;);
console.warn(&quot;Don't fall for the beautiful weather&quot;);
console.groupEnd(title);
</code></pre>
<h2>Using format specifiers</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, console logs can be more than just simple messages. You can include an eye-catching message or something more convincing as your favorite dog image.</p>
<p>All because you can use format specifiers inside them. How?</p>
<h2>List of available format specifiers</h2>
<ul>
<li>%s ‚áí Formats as string</li>
<li>%i ‚áí Formats as integer</li>
<li>%f ‚áí Formats as float</li>
<li>%O ‚áí Formats as object (yes that's capital O as in Oregano)</li>
<li>%o ‚áí Formats as DOM element</li>
<li>%c ‚áí Formats as CSS ‚ú®</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formats as string, integer, float</h2>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(
  &quot;%s, told me that we're going to mall today with %s&quot;,
  &quot;Alan&quot;,
  &quot;Mike&quot;
);
// Alan, told me that we're going to mall today with Mike

console.log(&quot;We had %i mangoes today&quot;, 56);
// We had 56 mangoes today

console.log(
  &quot;Did you know, Tesla Model S can reach 0 to 60 mph in %f seconds?&quot;,
  2.3
);
// Did you know, Tesla Model S can reach 0 to 60 mph in 2.3 seconds?
</code></pre>
<p>That's it, super easy! üòÉ</p>
<h2>ü§ùConclusion</h2>
<p>For me, all that mattered was for the logs to stand out and be more catchy on pursuit of which I found out a ton of more cool stuff we can do, hope this gives you more clarity on the gem of a function, that console is.</p>
